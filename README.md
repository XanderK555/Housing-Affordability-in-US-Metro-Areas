By Alexander Kasternakis

## Overview

This project explores housing data in the top 100 metro areas in the U.S. to analyze changes in housing affordability over time. Key metrics include real estate market trends, population growth, and per capita income. By examining these factors, we provide insights into how economic and demographic shifts have influenced the housing market.

## Objective

This analysis aims to answer the following questions:

1. How has the housing market changed in different metros over time?
2. How has population growth affected the housing market?
3. Are fluctuations in housing prices keeping up with rising income?
4. Which metro areas and regions have experienced the most significant shifts in affordability?
